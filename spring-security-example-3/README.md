In the example number three we are going to explore how to include additional behavior in the login and logout process.


* Check the new code included in the class SecurityConfiguration
* Check the login and logout definition. Execute a failed login or a logout and check what is happening.
* Change the current failure handler to the new one an repeat the login operation.
* Run the spring boot application in both cases.
