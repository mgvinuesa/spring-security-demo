In the example number two we are going to modify and evaluate how to override the default configurations

* Check the new code included in the class SecurityConfiguration
* Review the parent class, why is it deprecated ?
  * Check the class CustomAuthenticationProvider,  dis-comment the @Bean and test again.
  * Check the different 'configure' methods.
  * Check the commented @Bean.  Explore the class WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter and the method setApplicationContext and the LazyPasswordEncoder.

* Run the spring boot application.
