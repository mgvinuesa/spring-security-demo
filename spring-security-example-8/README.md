* Check the new code included in the class SecurityConfiguration:​
* See the sessionManagement configuration.​
* Change to STATELESS and try to login in the application, What does it happen?​
* Change to maximumSession to one and login in two browsers, what does it happen when login the second time?​
* Dis-comment the @Bean related with the session events.​
* See the application.yml to see different properties related with the session​
* Now explore the item list in different browsers and tabs. That is Session @Beans
